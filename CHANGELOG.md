# Changelog

## 0.10.0

### Fixed

- Fixed: on Windows, a lock cleanup refused because another worker still holds the file now waits instead of crashing.

### Breaking changes

- Caller-supplied tool names now narrow a legacy session's mode list by default,
  through both `send()` and `sendStructured()`. A name outside the ceiling is
  refused before a model call; an empty list offers no tools.
- To retain legacy replacement behavior, explicitly set
  `allowLegacyToolListWidening: true`. The authorizer still applies, and named
  agents always enforce their mode ceiling.
- Remove an explicit `narrowRequestedTools: false`; it now raises a migration
  error naming the new opt-out. Explicit `true` remains valid, but combining it
  with the widening opt-out is a configuration error.

Legacy duplicate-registration and address defaults retain their existing behavior.
