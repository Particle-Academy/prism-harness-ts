# Changelog

## 0.10.2

### Fixed

- Stream file-session log records instead of decoding the entire file as one
  string, so logs larger than the JavaScript string limit can reopen.
- Count completed log lines without loading message history. A disposable small
  sidecar avoids repeated scans after a new store instance; changed file metadata
  or an invalid index causes a streaming rebuild.
- Preserve incomplete-tail recovery, corrupt-record errors, cross-process locks
  and the existing sync on each durable append.

No breaking changes.

## 0.10.0

### Fixed

- Fixed: on Windows, a lock cleanup refused because another worker still holds the file now waits instead of crashing.

### Breaking changes

- Caller-supplied tool names now narrow a legacy session's mode list by default,
  through both `send()` and `sendStructured()`. A name outside the ceiling is
  refused before a model call; an empty list offers no tools.
- To retain legacy replacement behavior, explicitly set
  `allowLegacyToolListWidening: true`. The authorizer still applies, and named
  agents always enforce their mode ceiling.
- Remove an explicit `narrowRequestedTools: false`; it now raises a migration
  error naming the new opt-out. Explicit `true` remains valid, but combining it
  with the widening opt-out is a configuration error.

Legacy duplicate-registration and address defaults retain their existing behavior.
